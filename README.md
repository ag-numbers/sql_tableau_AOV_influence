# sql_tableau_AOV_influence
SQL + Tableau project exploring what drives higher Average Order Value (AOV) 
# 📊 Factors Influencing Average Order Value (AOV)

## 🧠 Project Overview
This project started with a simple question:  
**What makes some customers spend more than others?**

To answer that, I explored demographic, behavioral, decision-based, and contextual factors that might explain variations in AOV.  
The dataset was downloaded from **Kaggle** and contains data representing customer demographics, purchase behaviors, and decision-related attributes.

This project helped me deepen my SQL data cleaning and analytical thinking — especially around hypothesis testing and building a clear story in Tableau.

## 🧹 Data Preparation (SQL)
All data cleaning and transformation were done in **PostgreSQL**:

- Explored data
- Renamed columns for clarity
- Checked for missing values and verified dataset consistency
- Cleaned categories and removed special characters  
- Converted amount values from text to numeric  
- Created new calculated fields:
  - `age_group` (18–24, 25–32, 33-41, 42-50)
  - `decision_group` (Very fast, Average, Slow)
  - `loyalty_group` (High, Low)
  - `satisfaction_group` (High, Medium, Low)

## 🔍 Analysis Approach
- I built hypotheses based on real marketing segmentation frameworks
- Each hypothesis was tested in SQL
- The data was visualized in Tableau to either support or reject each hypotheses

## 📊 Hypotheses and Conclusions

| Slice Type | Hypothesis | Conclusion |
|-------------|-------------|------------|
| **Demographic** | Higher **income customers** have higher AOV | ❌ Not supported. Income level does not significantly influence purchase amount in this dataset. |
| **Demographic** | **Older** customers have higher AOV | ❌ Not supported. The youngest customer group (18–24) has the highest AOV. AOV gradually decreases with age but increases again for the oldest group. |
| **Behavioral** | Customers with higher **satisfaction rating** have higher AOV | ❌ Not supported. AOV does not increase with satisfaction. Medium satisfaction group has the highest AOV, which may be influenced by incentives. |
| **Behavioral** | Customers with high **ad engagement** have higher AOV | ❌ Not supported. Spending does not increase with ad engagement. |
| **Decision-based** | Customers with shorter **decision times** have higher AOV | ❌ Not supported. Customers with **average decision times** have the highest AOV. |
| **Decision-based** | Customers with strong **intent** (“planned”) have higher AOV than impulsive buyers | ❌ Not supported. **Desire-driven** (wants-based) purchases lead to the highest AOV, while impulsive intent shows the lowest. |
| **Contextual** | **Smartphone** users have higher AOV than desktop users | ✅ Supported. Smartphone customers have the highest AOV. |
| **Contextual** | Customers have higher AOV on **online** purchases than in-store | ⚠️ Partially supported. Customers using **mixed channels** have the highest AOV, suggesting the importance of **omnichannel integration**. |

## 🔗 Cross-Dimensional Hypotheses

To explore how multiple factors interact to influence spending behavior, I also tested several **cross-dimensional hypotheses**.  
These combine demographic, behavioral, and contextual variables to uncover deeper insights into customer spending patterns.

### 📊 Cross-Dimensional Findings

| Dimensions | Conclusion |
|-------------|-------------|
| **AOV by loyalty group & member** | Loyalty membership possession **positively increases AOV**. Loyal customers consistently spend more than non-members. |
| **AOV by income & age** | AOV is **higher among young customers with high income**. Income is a stronger driver for higher AOV than age. For customers aged **33+**, the difference in AOV by income level becomes minimal — suggesting older customers are more **budget-conscious**. |
| **AOV by social media influence & ad engagement** | *Wants-based intent* among customers **does not correlate with income**, indicating that emotionally driven purchases are not necessarily tied to financial level. |
| **AOV by intent & income** | High-income customers with **wants-based or planned intent** show the **highest AOV**, while impulsive buyers spend less regardless of income level. |

## 💡 Business Takeaways
- From contexual hypotheses: Optimize **mobile shopping experience** becuase smartphone users spend more  
- From decision-based hypothese: Target **emotion-driven customers** (wants-based intent)  
- Use **upsell opportunities** for ad-engaged users  
- Support **multi-channel experiences** to increase overall spending

## 🧩 Dashboard Structure
Each dashboard page explores a different perspective:

1. **Demographic & Behavioral Factors**
2. **Decision-based & Contextual Factors**
3. **Combined Factors (Cross-dimensional View)**

You can filter by **gender** or **category** to explore different spending patterns.
